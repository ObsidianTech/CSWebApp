This is the website for CryptoSound.com, developed in ASP.Net Core 2.1. 
CryptoSound is a music distibution platform, designed to sell and dispense tracks for people to use.
The front end will be integrated with Vue.JS to further decouple it from the api that is
responsible for relesing tracks and making payments. Eventually, there will be a progressive web app created to provide people with
notifications for when new stock is added.
